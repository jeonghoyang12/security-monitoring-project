## Security Best Practices

This project follows these security practices:

1. **No Credentials in Code**: We never store API keys, passwords, or other secrets in the repository.
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: We use pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental credential leakage.
3. **Dependency Scanning**: We regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
4. **Code Scanning**: We use automated tools to identify security issues in code.
5. **Principle of Least Privilege**: AWS resources use minimal permissions needed.
